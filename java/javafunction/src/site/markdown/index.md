# Java : Java Function

This sample describes how to use java functions in EventFlow.

## EventFlow under test

In this sample the following simple EventFlow fragment is used :

![Density](images/Density.png)

## Declare the java function

See [UtilFunctions.java](../../main/java/com/tibco/ep/samples/javafunction/UtilFunctions.java).


## Provide a engine configuration for EventFlow use

A engine configuration is required to declare the functions available :

```scala
name = "javafunction-engine"
version = "1.0.0"
type = "com.tibco.ep.streambase.configuration.sbengine"

configuration = {
    StreamBaseEngine = {
        streamBase = {
            pluginFunctions = {
                java = {
                    Density = {
                        type = "simple"
                        alias = "density"
                        className = "com.tibco.ep.samples.javafunction.UtilFunctions"
                        autoArguments = true
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}

```
