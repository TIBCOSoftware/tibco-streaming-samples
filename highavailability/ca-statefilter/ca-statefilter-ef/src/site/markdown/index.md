## Enable cluster aware settings in operator

A metronome adapter is used to emit tuples with a state filter.  The state filter is configured
to be **cluster aware** - that is, the operator is started and stopped depending on the state of the cluster.

## Design notes

The cluster aware option **Active on a single node in the cluster** was selected, hence :

* Only one node in the cluster will process the metronome tuples regardless of the number of nodes
* Should the node processing the metronome tuples fail, another node in the cluster will start processing the tuples

## Running this sample from TIBCO StreamBase&reg; Studio

Use the **Run As -> EventFlow Fragment** menu option to run in TIBCO StreamBase&reg; Studio.

Note that here we are unit testing the business logic rather than cluster aware - in this sample we test cluster aware in
the application archive integration test cases.
