## Machines and nodes

In this sample we name the machines as **A**,  which hosts the StreamBase node **A**, 
and **B**, which hosts the StreamBase node **B**.

![nodes](images/two-node-active-active-nodes.svg)

A client that uses the service can connect to either machine **A** or **B**.

( service names are omitted in descriptions for clarity )

<a name="data-partitioning"></a>

## Data partitioning

To support an active active configuration, the query table data must be replicated between the nodes.  
In this sample the default **default-cluster-wide-availability-zone** is used - a number of virtual
partitions are created to evenly balance and replicate data around the cluster :

( only 2 virtual partitions are shown - the default is 64 )

## Define the node deployment configuration

Since this sample uses the default availability zone, it doesn't need to be specified again, so
no node deployment configuration is required/

## Design notes

* The default dynamic data distribution policy is chosen to distribute the data across the cluster
* Most of the data distribution policy and the availability zone configuration values are not set since defaults work well

<a name="failure-scenarios"></a>

## Failure scenarios

The main failure cases for this deployment are outlined below :

Failure case   | Behavior on failure | Steps to resolve | Notes
--- | --- | --- | ---
Machine A fails | 1 Client is disconnected<br/>2 Virtual partitions become active on B<br/>3 Client may connect to B and continue  | 1 Fix machine A<br/>2 Use **epadmin install node** and **epadmin start node** | 1 No data loss<br/>2 No service loss
Machine B fails | 1 Client is disconnected<br/>2 Virtual partitions become active on A<br/>3 Client may connect to A and continue  | 1 Fix machine B<br/>2 Use **epadmin install node** and **epadmin start node** | 1 No data loss<br/>2 No service loss
Network fails  | 1 irtual partitions become active on both A and B<br/>**multi-master** scenario | 1 Fix network<br/>2 Use **epadmin restore availabilityzone** | 1 **Possible data loss**<br/>2 No service loss

With a 2 node configuration node quorums don't apply hence a multi-master scenario is possible on network failure.  
To avoid the risk of data loss when restoring the availability zone, multiple network paths ( such as network bonding )
is recommended.

## Building this sample from the command line and running the integration test cases

In this sample, some HA integration test cases are defined in the pom.xml that :

* start nodes A & B
* use **epadmin start playback** to inject tuples to node A
* use **epadmin read querytable** on node A to verify query table contents
* stop node A
* use **epadmin read querytable** on node B to verify no data loss
* stop node B

**Warning:** This does not constitute an exhaustive non-functional test plan

Use the [maven](https://maven.apache.org) as **mvn install** to build from the command line or Continuous Integration system :
