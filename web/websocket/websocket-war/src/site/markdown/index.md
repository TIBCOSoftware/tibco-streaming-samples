# Web : WebSocket WAR

This sample describes how to build a WAR (.war) which contains a WebSocket endpoint (/test).  After the 
WebSocket connection is built, this endpoint returns the same string as what it receives.
The resulting archive can then be used in a downstream EventFlow fragment.

## Create a WebSocket endpoint

Add the following maven dependency into the pom.xml, the scope should be provided

```xml

    <dependency>
        <groupId>jakarta.websocket</groupId>
        <artifactId>jakarta.websocket-api</artifactId>
        <version>1.1.1</version>
        <scope>provided</scope>
    </dependency>
```

The [sample java code](../../main/java/com/tibco/ep/samples/web/websocket/websocketwar/WebSocketEndpoint.java)([html](https://github.com/TIBCOSoftware/tibco-streaming-samples/tree/master/web/websocket/websocket-war/src//main/java/com/tibco/ep/samples/web/websocket/websocketwar/WebSocketEndpoint.java))  provides a WebSocket endpoint to intercept the received message as a string and send a response message with "Received messages:" prefix.

## Generate WAR archive

The project's packaging type is **war**.
```xml
    <groupId>com.tibco.ep.samples.web</groupId>
    <artifactId>websocket-war</artifactId>
    <packaging>war</packaging>
    <version>1.0.0</version>

```
The [maven war plugin](https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-war-plugin/) is used to build the WAR (.war).  The following maven build rule is used :

```xml
    <plugins>
        <plugin>
            <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
            <artifactId>maven-war-plugin</artifactId>
            <configuration>
                <failOnMissingWebXml>false</failOnMissingWebXml>
            </configuration>
            <version>3.2.3</version>
        </plugin>
    </plugins>
```
