## Create a WAR file which has web socket endpoint
See [websocket-war](../../../../websocket-war/src/site/markdown/index.md).
The WAR provides a GET endpoint which path is **http://<webserver-hostname>:<webserver-port-number>/websocket-war/test**.


<a name="declare-the-war-as-a-dependency"></a>

## Create an EventFlow fragment and declare the WAR as a dependency
In this sample, this sample contains [a no-op EventFlow file](../../main/eventflow/com/tibco/ep/samples/web/websocket/eventflow/WebSocket.sbapp),  
that represent a simply runnable Eventflow fragment.  To use the WAR, just add the WAR into fragment's pom.xml in the same 
way as any other maven dependency:

```xml
    <dependency>
        <groupId>com.tibco.ep.samples.web</groupId>
        <artifactId>websocket-war</artifactId>
        <version>1.0.0</version>
        <type>war</type>
    </dependency>
```

## Running this sample from TIBCO StreamBase&reg; Studio
Use the **Run As -> EventFlow Fragment** menu option to run in TIBCO StreamBase&reg; Studio:

<a name="using-epadmin-display-web-command-to-retrieve-information"></a>

## Using "epadmin display web" command to retrieve web information.
The information we need is **hostname**, **port number**, **web service name**

<a name="using-websocketclient-to-connect-to-the-websocket-endpoint"></a>

## Using [WebSocketClient](../../test/resources/WebSocketClient.html) to connect to the WebSocket endpoint
Open [WebSocketClient](../../test/resources/WebSocketClient.html) file in a web browser which supports WebSocket, 
fill the tables with the information got in last step, since we use **default-realm** in this sample, which does NOT 
require password when a connection originates from a trusted address, no password is entered. 
Then click **connect** button. After connection is built, type message in Message table 
and click **Send Message** button. Click **disconnect** for disconnecting from the WebSocket endpoint.

## Building this sample from the command line and running the integration test cases

In this sample, an integration test is defined in the **pom.xml** file. The test will:

* Start node A
* Trigger the java integration test: it has a websocket client with is trying to connect to the **/test** endpoint of depolyed websocket-war,
  once the connection is successful, it sends a message **Hello, TIBCO**, and validates the response message contains the 
  same message.
* Stop node A

Use the [maven](https://maven.apache.org) as **mvn install** to build from the command line or Continuous Integration system:
