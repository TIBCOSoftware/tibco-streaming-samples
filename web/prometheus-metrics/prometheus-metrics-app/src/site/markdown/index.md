# Web : Prometheus Metrics - APP

This sample describes how to retrieve TIBCO&reg; Streaming Metrics into Prometheus.

## Prometheus integration

A node **A** will be started containing the **prometheus-metrics-ef** event flow, itself depending
on the **prometheus-metrics-war** WAR. Upon startup, TIBCO&reg; Streaming will detect the WAR and
deploy it in its administration web engine. The Prometheus REST Endpoint will then begin to serve
Metrics data in a Prometheus consumable way.


## Prerequisites for full testing

The test uses docker to start a Prometheus instance. Therefore, docker must first be downloaded 
and installed - see https://www.docker.com/ for further details. Any recent version of docker 
should suffice, but testing was initially with docker Desktop 2.1.0.4 on MacOS 10.14.6 Mojave.

On MacOS, the resources available to docker may need to be increased beyond the default - see
CPUs and Memory settings on the Advanced tab of Docker preferences.

## Building this sample from the command line and running the integration test cases

In this sample, an integration test is defined in the **pom.xml** file. The test will:

* Start node A
* Start a docker container to run Prometheus. This Prometheus instance is configured to monitor
  metrics from node A through a **prometheus.yml** file.
* Wait for node A to come up
* Trigger the java integration test: it consists in polling the Prometheus instance HTTP
  interface for a builtin TIBCO&reg; Streaming Metric name to come up.
* Stop the Prometheus docker container
* Stop node A


**Warning:** This does not constitute an exhaustive non-functional test plan

Use the [maven](https://maven.apache.org) as **mvn install** to build from the command line or Continuous Integration system :

If docker cannot be found on the machine, the tests will only consists in a start/stop of the 
application, without the Prometheus container start/stop and without the java integration test.
